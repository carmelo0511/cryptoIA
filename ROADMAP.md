# CryptoAI Analytics - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
**Title:** CryptoAI Analytics - Predictive Crypto Analysis Platform with Vision Transformer for Chart Pattern Recognition

**Main Objective:** Develop a scalable, low-cost AI platform to analyze crypto markets in real-time, predicting trends via multi-modal data (price, social sentiment, on-chain) and visually detecting trading patterns on charts. Portfolio-ready project featuring advanced technology, economics, and a "wow factor" via Computer Vision.

## Architecture Stack

### Backend (Serverless)
- **AWS Lambda** (ML inference, 128MB-3GB RAM)
- **DynamoDB** (pattern caching with 7-day TTL)
- **S3** (chart storage)
- **API Gateway** (REST endpoints with 5min cache)

### Frontend
- **React** with Canvas for visual overlay of detected patterns
- Real-time chart overlay (lines and labels)

### AI/ML
- **Vision Transformer** (quantified ONNX, ~50MB) for pattern detection
- **Google Colab** training (free GPU/Pro ~10‚Ç¨/month)
- Target precision: 75-85%

### Data Pipeline
- **WebSocket** for real-time crypto prices
- Batch processing every 5min for vision analysis
- Auto-generation of 500+ chart images for dataset

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform** for automated deployment
- **CloudWatch** monitoring & security
- **IAM roles**, encryption, rate limiting

### Cost Optimization
- Aggressive batch/caching, auto-cleanup (TTL/Lifecycle)
- Model quantization
- **Development budget:** ~10‚Ç¨ (Colab)
- **Production:** ~15-17‚Ç¨/month (Lambda 8‚Ç¨, DynamoDB 3‚Ç¨, S3 4‚Ç¨, other 2‚Ç¨)

## Success Metrics
- **Latency:** <100ms
- **Accuracy:** >85%
- **Uptime:** 99.9%
- **Business:** 6-month backtesting, 10k predictions/day, scalable to 100k analyses/month
