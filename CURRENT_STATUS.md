# 📋 CryptoAI Analytics - Current Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-27  
**Current Session Status:** Phase 2 COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 Phase Completion Overview

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure & Data Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- AWS infrastructure deployed and operational
- API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, S3 configured
- All endpoints tested and functional
- Live API: `https://pbqj4cxv71.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

### ✅ Phase 2: Vision Transformer Training (COMPLETED)
- **Training Results:** 90.5% validation accuracy (exceeded 75-85% target)
- **Models Exported:** 
  - `backend/models/crypto_pattern_model_v14.onnx` (327.5MB) - Production ready
  - `backend/models/best_model.pth` (327MB) - PyTorch checkpoint
- **Pattern Classes:** 10 crypto chart patterns fully implemented
- **Git LFS:** Configured and models successfully uploaded to GitHub
- **Verification:** All tests passed (ONNX inference, pattern recognition, file integrity)

## 🚀 Phase 3: Backend & AI Integration (READY TO START)

### Next Session Action Plan

When resuming work, execute Phase 3 with these specific tasks:

#### 1. Deploy Lambda Container for Vision Inference
```bash
# Priority 1: Create Lambda container with ONNX runtime
cd backend/
# Create Dockerfile with ONNX runtime + model
# Deploy as Lambda Container function
```

#### 2. Integrate Vision Model with API
```bash
# Priority 2: Update existing Lambda functions
# Add vision inference endpoints:
# POST /analyze-chart - Upload chart image, return pattern prediction
# GET /patterns/{symbol}/visual - Real-time pattern detection
```

#### 3. End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Priority 3: Test complete pipeline
# Infrastructure → Vision Model → API Response
# Validate latency < 100ms target
```

### 📁 Key File Locations

**Models (Ready for Integration):**
- `backend/models/crypto_pattern_model_v14.onnx` - Production ONNX model
- `backend/test_model.py` - Model verification script

**Infrastructure (Deployed):**
- `infrastructure/` - Terraform AWS setup (operational)
- `backend/src/` - Existing Lambda functions (need vision integration)

**Training (Completed):**
- `training/train_vision_transformer.py` - Complete training pipeline
- `training/CryptoAI_Vision_Training.ipynb` - Colab notebook (executed)

### 🎯 Success Criteria for Phase 3
- [ ] Lambda Container deployed with ONNX model
- [ ] New API endpoints for vision inference
- [ ] End-to-end latency < 100ms
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Ready for Phase 4 (Frontend)

### ⚡ Quick Start Commands for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Verify current status
cd /Users/bryannakache/portfolio/cryptoIA-1
git status
python backend/test_model.py

# 2. Start Phase 3
# Create Lambda Container with vision model
# Update API Gateway with new endpoints
# Test end-to-end pipeline

# 3. Validate deployment
# Test vision inference API
# Measure latency and accuracy
```

### 💡 Context for Next Developer/Session

**What has been accomplished:**
1. **Complete infrastructure** deployed on AWS (Phase 1)
2. **Vision Transformer trained** to 90.5% accuracy (Phase 2)
3. **Models exported** and integrated via Git LFS
4. **All verification tests** passing

**What needs to be done next:**
1. **Deploy Vision model** to Lambda Container
2. **Create API endpoints** for chart pattern analysis
3. **Integrate with existing** infrastructure
4. **Test end-to-end** pipeline performance

**Important Notes:**
- Models are 327MB each, handled via Git LFS
- Target latency: <100ms per inference
- 10 pattern classes: head_and_shoulders, double_top, etc.
- AWS Account: 304783065136 (us-east-1)
